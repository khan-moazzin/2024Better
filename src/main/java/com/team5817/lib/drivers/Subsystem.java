/**
 * The Subsystem abstract class, which serves as a basic framework for all robot
 * subsystems. Each subsystem outputs
 * commands to SmartDashboard, has a stop routine (for after each match), and a
 * routine to zero all sensors, which helps
 * with calibration.
 * <p>
 * All Subsystems only have one instance (after all, one robot does not have two
 * drivetrains), and functions get the
 * instance of the drivetrain and act accordingly. Subsystems are also a state
 * machine with a desired state and actual
 * state; the robot code will try to match the two states with actions. Each
 * Subsystem also is responsible for
 * instantializing all member components at the start of the match.
